    "# Getting Started with AstroBkgInterp: JWST/MIRI Imaging Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an analysis of JWST imaging data of the Type II supernova SN 2021afdx (Engesser, M., TNSAN.155, 2022), which was imaged serendipitously as part of the Early Release Observations of the Cartwheel Galaxy [Program 2727](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=2727) (PI: Pontoppidan). This tutorial offers a detailed, step-by-step guide for estimating and subtracting backgrounds using the AstroBkgInterp package. By the end of this notebook, you will gain hands-on experience with the tools and techniques provided by AstroBkgInterp. This knowledge will enable you to apply the package to similar datasets, whether they are 2D or 3D, or obtained from other instruments or telescopes.\n",

    "## Introduction \n",
    "Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are critical probes of massive stellar evolution and chemical enrichment in galaxies. However, they are often embedded in crowded or high surface-brightness regions of their host galaxies, where background emission is spatially structured and varies on small angular scales. In such environments, precise background estimation is essential for isolating the supernova signal and deriving reliable photometry. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the Type II Supernova SN 2021afdx, first identified in JWST observations of the Cartwheel Galaxy by Engesser et al. (2022). The supernova (SN) is superimposed on a bright, inctricately structured mid-infrared background, comprising of both telescope/thermal contributions and astrophysical emission from the host galaxy. Accurately subtracting this background is therefore essential to recover the intrinsic SN flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, we use `AstroBkgInterp` to perform accurate, spatially resolved background subtraction tailored to the complex environment of SN 2021afdx. First, we apply its source-masking procedure to mask the SN and interpolate over its location, providing an estimate of the underlying background and ensuring that the SN flux does not bias the final fit. We then use `AstroBkgInterp` to construct a global background model from the masked data, which is subsequently subtracted from the original image to isolate the SN signal."

    "## Source-Masking Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical feature of `AstroBkgInterp` is its ability to exclude flux from astrophysical sources during the background estimation process. It implements a flexible and configurable source-masking routine that enables users to define regions of interest (typically containing one or more sources) to be excluded from the final background model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The user defines the position of the target source, along with an aperture geometry and size; both circular and elliptical apertures are supported. These apertures define the region to be masked and replaced with an interpolated estimate of the underlying background. In polar coordinates centered on the source, the algorithm computes the median flux at each angle from the surrounding annulus and interpolates across the masked region. This directionally informed approach preserves local background structure while excluding contamination from the source itself. To increase robustness and minimize interpolation artifacts, the procedure is repeated in a grid of eight dithered positions surrounding the central source, and the resulting estimates are median-combined to produce the final background.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 3D data cubes, `AstroBkgInterp` supports wavelength-dependent masking, allowing for the mask to vary as a function of wavelength. This capability accommodates the variation in PSF size with wavelength, and spectral variations in source morphology, ensuring accurate background estimation across the full spectral range."

    "\n",
    "To utilize `AstroBkgInterp`'s source-masking algorithm, we first need to identify the position of the source. Rather than relying solely on the coordinates provided in the image header, we begin by identifying the brightest source in the data cube, which we assume to be the supernova (SN). To accomplish this, we use `DAOStarFinder`, an implementation of the DAOFIND algorithm [Stetson 1987](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987PASP...99..191S/abstract) designed for point-source detection in astronomical images. DAOFIND locates local maxima in the image that exceed a specified `threshold` (applied to a convolved image) and have a size and shape similar to the defined 2D Gaussian kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: both the detection threshold and maximum separation allowed between neighboring sources should be adjusted based on the specific science case (e.g., the number of stars in the field, the degree of crowding, and the expected brightness distribution)."

The image is subdivided into a series of overlapping subregions, and a low-order polynomial is independently fit to each region. These fits are then median combined at each pixel location, effectively mitigating the influence of outliers, cosmic rays, and localized noise features. The result is a smooth and robust background model that preserves large-scale background structure while expressing small-scale fluctuations. \n",

We adopt the default value of `k = 3`, which provides a good balance between smoothness and adaptability.\n",
