AstroBkgInterp is a tool for background subtraction in complex regions for
point sources. AstroBkgInterp computes a reasonable background estimation
for 2D and 3D astronomical data using a combination of interpolation and
polynomial fitting methods to calculate the background. It is used to
improve photometry on sources where the local background is complex and/or
bright.
